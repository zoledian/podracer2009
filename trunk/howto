/* HOW TO CREATE A LEVEL */

A level has the syntax

0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1
0 30 -2
2 2 3 2 2

EVERY SECOND ROW ("0 0 0" in the example) is an information row.
This row gives the loader information about the coming row of blocks.
The first 0 is just to tell the loader that is is reading an information row.
The second number is the angle in degrees.
The third number is hight adjustment.

Any other rows tells the loader what kind of blocks it should create.
1 = No block at all.
2 = Ordinary block.
3 = Jump block.
